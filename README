Motivation
----------

The Logitech K400 keyboard under Linux presents as a single
device that combines both its trackpad and keyboard events.
This can be a problem when using "kmonad" keyboard manager,
as it will completely filter all trackpad events, rendering
that part of the device inoperative.

This small program, attaches to the Logitech device, and
creates two new devices "Split Keyboard", and "Split Mouse"
that receive the respective events from the Logitech device.

Kmonad can then be configured to use the "Split Keyboard"
device, leaving the "Split Mouse" device available for
normal trackpad usage.


Disclaimer
----------

This program was hacked together without a deep understanding
of the underlying technology.  It is surely deficient in multiple
ways.  Patches welcome.

Likely the actual proper fix is for the original Logitech
device to not combine these events in the first place.
